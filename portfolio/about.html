            Hi, I’m <strong>Theresa Foley</strong>, a senior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst pursuing a dual degree in 
            <strong>Computer Science and English</strong>, with concentrations in <strong>Professional Technical Writing</strong> 
            and <strong>Creative Writing</strong>. My academic journey bridges two worlds—where logic meets imagination, and coding coexists 
            with storytelling. I’m deeply interested in the ethical and human-centered intersections of technology and language, 
            and I aim to build a career that integrates both.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've contributed to projects ranging from user interface recommendations for an augmented reality 3D printing company 
            (CADSPARC, LLC), to teaching programming to elementary and middle school students through gbSTEM. There, I introduced 
            children to Scratch and Snap, helping them build their own games and interactive animations. I also participated in the 
            <strong>Oxford Summer Seminar</strong>, where I studied British detective fiction and the work of Jane Austen—an experience 
            that sharpened my literary analysis and deepened my appreciation for storytelling across cultures.
          </p>
          <p>
            My technical background includes programming languages like <strong>Java, C++, Scratch</strong>, and <strong>Snap</strong>. 
            I’ve also worked in various service roles, from dining and customer service to security, which have built my adaptability, 
            teamwork, and empathy. I’m currently exploring web development, ethical computing, and user-centered design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creative writing remains a central passion. My poetry and prose often explore themes of revolution, identity, resistance, 
            and the surreal. I challenge traditional form and voice to engage readers in bold, often mystical explorations of the human 
            condition. I’m an active member of campus communities like <strong>WiCS (Women in Informatics and Computer Science)</strong>, 
            the <strong>K-Pop Dance Club</strong>, and several language learning groups.
          </p>
          <p>
            Above all, I believe in the transformative power of storytelling, compassion, and interdisciplinary thinking. Whether in 
            technical projects or creative work, I strive to spark conversation, build connection, and inspire positive change.
          </p>
